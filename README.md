TourBonbons
===========

This project is a game made with Qt blatantly copying the online game "Magnet Towers", available here : 

http://www.gamesolo.com/flash-game/magnet-towers.html

So why did I copied a game but 10x worse? I just wanted to learn Qt basics :)

## How To Play
Download the repository, click on **TourBonbons.exe in the release folder**

## Instructions
**Hover over sweets** with your mouse to collect them, then **click to eat** them. Careful, if you hover over a sweet of a different colour, you lose all the sweets you didn't eat yet!

The more you eat at the same time, the more points you get, so for max points you need to eat all sweets of the same colour together!

## Change settings (difficulty, window size...)
There is no in-game menu, but some settings are easily accessible in the code at the top of the file **src/mainwindow.h**
